# spread_joy

Spread-Joy is an online broadcasting application where anyone with an account can share stories or personal experiences which can entertain, help or motivate people. Categories can be motivational speeches, life experiences, story books etc. There are many benefits from this application: 
 -- Users can listen to motivational speeches when they feel down or when they need 
 -- Users can listen to stories when they are engaged in another activity (ex: cooking, travelling etc.) 
 -- Parents can let their kids listen to stories instead of watching videos 
 -- Users can share success stories, life experiences which might help other people 
 -- Differently abled people can listen to stories (instead of reading books) 
 
The idea of creating such software came up because, when some people watch a video on social media to relax or get motivated, they keep watching for hours but if we listen to a story it wonâ€™t happen, and this can save time. This is a major problem for the young generation, they might want to watch one or two videos but as social media keep suggesting videos people spend hours watching them.
